# TIC-TAC-TOE
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play locally in their browser by taking turns marking X and O in a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.
